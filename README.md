# Zomato Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository focuses on performing a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Zomato dataset. The analysis includes various components such as word cloud analysis and base map analysis. By leveraging these techniques, we can gain valuable insights into restaurant trends, popular cuisines, ratings, reviews, and geographical distribution of restaurants. The findings from this analysis can be used to inform business strategies, decision-making, and enhance the overall dining experience.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the Zomato dataset, handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

- **Word Cloud Analysis**: Generate visually appealing word clouds to identify the most frequently occurring words in restaurant names, cuisines, or user reviews. Uncover popular keywords and trends in the Zomato dataset.

- **Base Map Analysis**: Utilize geospatial analysis techniques to plot the geographical distribution of restaurants on a base map. Visualize restaurant density and identify popular dining areas or clusters.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Perform comprehensive analysis of the Zomato dataset, including descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis. Gain insights into restaurant ratings, user reviews, pricing, and cuisine preferences.

## Usage

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the Zomato dataset, handle missing values, and standardize data formats using appropriate techniques.

2. **Word Cloud Analysis**: Generate word clouds to visualize popular words or keywords related to restaurant names, cuisines, or user reviews.

3. **Base Map Analysis**: Utilize geospatial analysis libraries to plot the geographical distribution of restaurants on a base map. Explore restaurant density and popular dining areas.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct descriptive statistics, visualizations, and correlation analysis to gain insights into restaurant ratings, reviews, pricing, and cuisine preferences.

5. **Visualization and Reporting**: Present the analysis results using charts, graphs, and interactive visualizations. Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the key findings and actionable insights.
